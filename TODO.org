* Features
** TODO Allow outcome distributions to be both positive and negative

It may be better to use as a two-sided log-normal distribution (i.e. a regular log-normal distribution combined with the same distribution flipped over the Y axis). Unclear about the details.
** TODO Break down effects on factory-farmed animals into multiple categories for different types of animals

Might be overcomplicated and not worth it
** TODO Write function to sum multiple distributions where you specify at runtime which are positive or negative
** More comprehensively list plausible far-future outcomes
*** TODO Competitive ems that outcompete humans
see http://www.nickbostrom.com/fut/evolution.html
*** TODO Somehow account for unpredictable outcomes
* Refactor
** TODO For posterior, represent estimate as buckets instead of converting to lognormal distribution, which loses accuracy
* Bugs
No known bugs right now. Yay!
